  author: S.Kievskiy
  gui: "<strong>GUI (Graphical User Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface) </strong> is one of the types of user interfaces, the elements of which are made in the form of graphical images. That is, all the main objects present in this interface - icons, function buttons, menu objects, etc. - made in the form of images. If we compare the GUI with the usual command line, then in the first version, the user has full access to absolutely all the elements that he sees on the display. This access can be implemented using different input devices: an optical mouse, trackball, keyboard, joystick, etc. Usually, in the GUI, each graphic object conveys the meaning of a function using an understandable image, so that it is easier for the user to understand certain software and easier to interact with the OS in the whole. But it is important to understand that the GUI is only an integral part of the graphical interface. It functions at the level of data visualization and interacts with the user in the same way."
  cli: <strong>CLI - command line interface</strong> - command line interface, that is, the case when we perform some action using the terminal.
  apis:
    line1: The <strong>API is the Application Programming Interface</strong>, or application programming interface through which one program can communicate with another. The API allows information to be sent directly from one program to another, bypassing the user interface.
    line2: <strong> How does it work?</strong> Imagine that you are sitting in a restaurant, choosing a dish from the menu. A waiter comes up and you place an order. The waiter passes your order to the kitchen, the magic happens there, and after a while the finished dish appears in front of you. The API works on the same principle - it accepts your request, transfers information to the system, processes it and returns a response.
    line3: <strong> What are they? </strong> API can be internal, private - when software components are connected and used within the system. Or it can be open, public - in this case, it allows external users or other programs to receive information that can be integrated into their applications.
    line4: In order for programs to communicate with each other, their API must be built according to a single standard. One of them is REST, a standard for the architecture of the interaction between applications and sites that uses the HTTP protocol. The peculiarity of REST is that the server does not remember the state of the user between requests. In other words, user identification (authorization token) and all parameters of the operation are passed in each request. This approach is so simple and convenient that it has almost supplanted all others.
  mobile: Everything is the same as in the GUI, only the peculiarity of smartphones is that there are many of them and each has its own screen resolution. They have their own applications for their screens and the display of the site in the mobile version is different from the desktop version. Because of this, testing mobile versions and software on mobile phones is considered one of the most difficult.

        tab: What is software testing?
        describe:
          line1: Software testing is the process of verifying that the requirements from the customer and what the programmers wrote.
          line2: The process when we check how it should be and how it really is, we call it - testing.
          line3: Each testing has a life cycle (LC). Not to be confused with development lifecycle or development methodology.
          line4: Lifecycle testing is the stages from the very beginning of testing and finding errors (bugs), inconsistencies, etc., to its end, when all the errors are corrected - when the product meets the terms of reference (TOR) from the customer.
          line5: Most often, in the testing process, additions to the TK arise, since some things, for example, are technically impossible to implement and other implementation options are found so that the task from the TK is performed.
          line6: "Let's consider, so what is the \" Life cycle in testing \"and its stages:"
          line7: 1. <em> Requirements planning and analysis </em> - you just look at what they want from you and say \ "It will take me two days to parse and see what is ready and what is not in the software \". <p>
          line8: 2. <em> Clarification of acceptance criteria </em> - after you have read and looked at the raw functionality, you will definitely clarify the minimum requirements for the software to work. Step is required. <p>
          line9: 3. <em> Clarifying the testing strategy </em> - in principle, you can do without it. But it is important to understand that the strategy in testing is the organization of the testing process itself, subject to limited resources. Therefore, it would be nice to understand what resources are available in general. Plus, a testing strategy is needed so that each of the participants understands what is the role of testing in the project, what is being tested, how it is tested, and so that everyone has a real understanding in anticipation of what is generally going on in quality control. <p>
          line10: "4. <em> Development of test documentation </em> - this is what many automators do not like, this is writing test cases. At this stage, development, revision, test documentation takes place: test case, test suite, test plans <p> "
          line11: 5. <em> Executing test cases and Fixing found defects </em> - speaks for itself. We recorded a step-by-step execution of some small piece of software (test case) and began to test it. Oops! The performed check from the test case does not correspond to what is actually in the software - we write an error in the bug tracking (platform for fixing any bug, task, epik, etc.) <p>
          line12: "6. <em> Analysis of test results and reporting - I will write about this as they write in the Internet: the formulated conclusions depend on the test plan and acceptance criteria and serve as the basis for stages 1, 2, 3 of the next iteration. </em>"
          line13: <em> Planning is a continuous process of making managerial decisions and methodological organization of efforts to implement them in order to ensure the quality of a certain process over a long period of time. In fact, it is your colleagues who gather and discuss some kind of revision - in this case, based on your experience, say that, for example, it will take you two days to test this revision when it is ready. <br> <br> Reporting is collection and dissemination of information on the results of work (including the current status, assessment of progress and forecast of the development of the situation). </em> </blockquote>
          line14: "It all sounds awful and incomprehensible - but this is only for now, when the practice begins, for you everything that is written above will become familiar and understandable. Let's go further!"
          line15: Since there are many approaches in the testing life cycle, in the testing itself we output <a href="#" id="type_testing" onclick=clickTab("#types-qa")> Types of testing </a>

          head: "It is necessary to highlight the main types of testing:"
          functional_testing: Functional testing
          functional_testing_describe: Functionality check (testing by the "black box" method) - checking the compliance of the software with the requirements stated in the specification. Both full testing of the declared functionality and verification of only basic functionality can be carried out. White box testing testing for compliance of a software product with requirements with knowledge of the internal structure of the system implementation (source code and technical specifications are available). Black box testing testing for compliance of a software product with requirements without knowing the internal structure of the system implementation.
          system_testing: System testing
          system_testing_describe: High-level verification of the functionality of the entire program or the system as a whole. Or, more simply, the system, platform or environment is checked where this or that software should work.
          performance_testing: Performance testing
          performance_testing_describe: <p> Testing to determine how quickly a system or part of it performs under a given load.</p><ul><li><b>Load testing</b></li></ul><p>Testing is intended to verify the system's performance under standard loads and to determine the maximum possible peak at which the system operates correctly.</p><ul><li><b>Stress testing </b></li></ul><p>Testing is intended to check the system performance under<i>non</i>standard loads and to determine the maximum possible peak at which the system operates correctly. It is also intended to identify the results in which the system goes into a non-working state.</p>
          regression_testing: Regression testing
          regression_testing_describe: Regression testing is done to check if new features, enhancements, and fixed defects affect the existing functionality of the product, or if old defects arise.
          unit_testing: Unit testing
          unit_testing_describe: Each complex software system consists of separate parts - modules that perform a particular function as part of the system. In order to make sure that the entire system is working correctly, you must first test each module of the system separately. If problems arise during testing the system as a whole, this makes it easier to identify the modules that caused the problem and eliminate the corresponding defects in them. This unit testing is individually called unit testing.
          security_testing: Security testing
          security_testing_describe: Security testing is a testing strategy used to verify the security of a system, as well as to analyze the risks associated with ensuring a holistic approach to protecting an application, hacker attacks, viruses, and unauthorized access to confidential data.
          localization_testing: Localization testing
          localization_testing_describe: Localization testing is the process of testing a localized version of a software product. Checking the correctness of the translation of the user interface elements, checking the correctness of the translation of system messages and errors, checking the translation of the "Help" / "Support" section and accompanying documentation.
          usability_testing: Usability testing
          usability_testing_describe: Usability testing is a testing method aimed at establishing the degree of usability, learnability, comprehensibility and attractiveness to users of the developed product in the context of specified conditions. To identify problems associated with a specific interface mechanism to determine whether there are problems with the usability of the interface for navigation, using the main functionality.

        tab: Who are QA?
        head: QA - is not a profession, but inspiration and eternal improvement!
        describe: "The job of a Quality Assurance engineer is most likely to control the correct execution of all stages of development and the correct operation of the final product. It is very similar to what a manual tester monitors. for revision, if there are bugs or inaccuracies. The QA engineer also adheres to the standards of software development, interacts with many people, such as programmers, analysts, product owners, customers, designers, etc., but more closely. He literally climbs into the product and takes it apart piece by piece, and when he sees in general what and how, he can prompt or prevent the appearance of bugs by telling colleagues about the problems found. "
        describe2: "A QA engineer is a person who sees the product from the outside, inside, and as an outside observer who is far from IT. But in order to see so much you need to practice and gain experience."
        responsibilities: "The responsibilities of a tester most often include:"
